#### todo : negative image

             A positive image is a normal image. A negative image is a total inversion, in which light areas appear dark and                            vice versa. A negative color image is additionally color-reversed,[2] with red areas appearing cyan, 
             greens appearing magenta, and blues appearing yellow, and vice versa.
